MICoDE is short for "Mining Implicit Code Design", which is a tool to automatically extract and abstract recurring designs from code base into design templates. The mined templates allows developers to make further customization for generating new code. The generated code involves the code skeleton of recurring design as well as the code bodies annotated with comments and hints to remind developers of necessary modification. A short demonstration of MICoDe is available in http://linyun.info/micode/index.html.
